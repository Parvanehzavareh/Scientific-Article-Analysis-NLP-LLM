Scientific Article Analysis with NLP and Generative AI
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and clustering scientific articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). The objective is to uncover thematic structures, generate concise summaries, and categorize articles for improved research insights.

Developed as part of the DSP5200: Data Analytics with Generative AI and Large Language Models course at Kristiania University College, Oslo, Norway.

Features
Topic Modeling: Identify key themes and topics within the dataset using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
Text Classification: Classify articles into predefined categories using machine learning and deep learning methods.
Text Summarization: Leverage Generative AI (e.g., GPT-based models) to produce concise and meaningful summaries of articles.
Visualization: Generate insightful visualizations for topic distribution and clustering results.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x
Libraries:
NLP: gensim, nltk, spaCy
Generative AI: transformers, OpenAI API
Data Processing: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, pyLDAvis
Development Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
Dataset
The dataset consists of abstracts of articles sourced from publicly available repositories, related to topics in energy, smart homes, and AI applications. The dataset includes:

50 research article abstracts
Processed with techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization

Results
Topics Identified: Key topics were identified across research articles, providing insights into thematic distributions.
Summaries Generated: Summaries of articles helped in quickly understanding research contributions.
Clustering: Articles were grouped into clusters based on semantic similarity.
